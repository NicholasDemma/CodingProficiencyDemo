# CodingProficiencyDemo
This repository is where I will keep my ongoing coding proficiency demo project. This project is meant to show my coding proficiency in a hands on environment, as opposed to pure book smarts as I believe that an example of my work would do a lot more justice then being able to name or describe abstract processes. While I can do that, here you can see what I can actually do given a computer, programming software, and enough time. The goal of this project is to show that I can write efficient, dynamic, and very complex code that is also well annotated so another developer could understand it without having to work with confusing names or functions. Although some of the simpler
and more obvious functions were given little to no commentation. 

Work spent estimation
Inital commit 3/15/2024: 3 months part time for an estimated 250 hours total. Time was spent building project from scratch with no prior knowledge of the renpy engine and little knowledge of python. This is a solid foundation
but lacks true complete dynamicy for every situation that could arise. While it works and is relatively bug free (I can not find any bugs on windows 10) all of the features have not been properly fleshed out and shown off in
the actual running of the program so the next commit will seek to fix that before adding more features.
